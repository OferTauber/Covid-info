# Covid-info

This fun little app presents up-to-date data on Covid-19 cases in all countries and continents of the world.
Paste and recovery data are obtained using an API from the about-corona platform (which itself receives the information using the John Hopkins University API).
The division of world countries into regions / continents is based on information coming from another free API: "Restcountries" by Hengki Sihombing (https://github.com/hengkiardo)
The app uses the "Allorigins" proxy (https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=)
The graph is displayed using the Chrts JS library
